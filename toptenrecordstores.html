                <br>
                <p>It seems like this store is one of the last of a dying breed of vinyl trading in Jamaica, the aesthetics of the store resemble what seems to be more of a heritage site for physical vinyl sales. ‘Mitchie’ Williams is the emperor at the seat of this artistic shrine.</p>
